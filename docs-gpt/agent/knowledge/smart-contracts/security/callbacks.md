---## Private Callbacks
In order for your contract to call itself when a cross-contract call is done, you need to make the callback method public. However, most of the times you would want it to be private. You can make it private while keeping it public by asserting that the `predecessor` is `current_account`. In rust this is done automatically by adding the `#[private]` decorator.

## User's Money
When a method panics, the money attached to that transaction returns to the `predecessor`. This means that, if you make a cross-contract call and it fails, then the money **returns to your contract**. If the money came from a user calling your contract, then you should transfer it back during the callback.

:::caution
Make sure you pass have enough GAS in the callback to make the transfer

## Async Callbacks
Between a cross-contract call and its callback **any method of your contract can be executed**. Not taking this into account is one of the main sources of exploits. It is so common that it has its own name: reentrancy attacks.

Imagine that we develop a `deposit_and_stake` with the following **wrong logic**: (1) The user sends us money, (2) we add it to its balance, (3) we try to stake it in a validator, (4) if the staking fails, we remove the balance in the callback. Then, a user could schedule a call to withdraw between (2) and (4), and, if the staking failed, we would send money twice to the user.

*Between a cross-contract call and the callback anything could happen*

Luckily for us the solution is rather simple. Instead of immediately adding the money to our userâ€™s balance, we wait until the callback. There we check, and if the staking went well, then we add it to their balance.
